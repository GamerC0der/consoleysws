# Days Prior to Kickoff Call:

I began the project and I started with a 3D cube in Love**2D** (emphasis on 2D), and while it was impressive, it barely ran at 30fps. It didn't seem feasible to me so I decided to not do it. I also made a small isometric ground prototype but it would crash frequently. 

I then scrolled through itch.io and found some art I liked, one from a roguelite style game (I didn't end up using it) and a platformer which I ended up using for the background.

So I intergrated the background, using a parallax effect and it looked kinda cool. Still no gameplay, but what could I make using this base?

Decisions, decisions, decisions. What about a shmup? (Shoot 'em up), I added a player, some enemies and movement, you could shoot them in one shot and kill them.

# Day 1

I increased the enemies to 4 (instead of 3) and fixed a bug where you can't kill the final enemy!
